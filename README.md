# Browser based matplotlib live graph

The live_plot.py contains my personal code for plotting real time plots using matplotlib and accessing it via web browser.

To test this, simply clone this repo and run live_plot.py in your shell.

The template can be modified as per individual use and can be integrated with other options like seaborn.
